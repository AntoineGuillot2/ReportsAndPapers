# Reports from my MSc in Applied mathématics, computer vision and Machine Learning

The repo contains few of my reports done for several project during my final year at Centrale Paris (Msc in Mathématics,Diplôme d'ingénieur) and Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (Maths, vision and apprentissage). 

- Improvement of **Learning to act by predicting the future** (Alexey Dosovitskiy, Vladlen Koltun, ICLR 2017): By adding a [semantic segmentation over the visual stream](https://github.com/AntoineGuillot2/ReportsAndPapers/blob/master/Improving_Learning_To_act_by_predicting_the_future.pdf), we managed to strongly improve the performance of the agent (+ 50 %) and to increase the speed of convergence.

- **Classification of EEG and sleep stages**: In order to classify EEG, we proposed an hybrid net [with 1D convolutions followed by Bi-LSTM cells](https://github.com/AntoineGuillot2/ReportsAndPapers/blob/master/Dreem_ENS_EEG_Classification.pdf). Our model was ranked second and very close to the first contribution while being computationnaly effective.

- **[Automated cluster dectection and efficient two-samples test for large dimensionnal data](https://github.com/AntoineGuillot2/ReportsAndPapers/blob/master/Two_sample_test.pdf)**: Following a paper from one of our professor and his project proposal, we proposed an improvement of the [ToMATo algorithm](https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/data/Steve.Oudot/clustering/) to detect the natural number of clusters in a dataset. This helped us to select the right kernel size and to propose an alternative to Kernel two-samples test with our Kernel-PCa two samples test.

- **[Efficient two-samples test for high dimensionnal and large datasets](https://github.com/AntoineGuillot2/ReportsAndPapers/blob/master/Two_samples_test_with_random_graph.pdf)**: We proposed a method based on large random matrices theory and their eigenvalues distribution to compare two samples.
